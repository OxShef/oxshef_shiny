# Why use the navbarPage template?

The navbarPage template is very flexible as it provides a horizontal navigation menu at the top of the app for splitting your visualisations into sections and to add an "about" page. It is highly recommended you use a derivative of this template for publishing to the University of Oxford's IDN as it makes supporting [converting your app to static images](idn_info.html#static-image) simple.
