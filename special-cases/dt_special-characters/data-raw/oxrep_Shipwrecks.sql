The two instruments found on the shipwreck are the earliest preserved classical Greek measuring tools. The two units represented on the rule are identified as a Pheidonian and a Solonian foot, whose ratio may be correlated precisely to a statement by Aristotle about the metrological reform of Solon. The square used a shorter unit, identical to a measure known from Hellenistic and Roman times as the Italic foot, whose length was five-sixths of a Pheidonian foot. The notched subdivisions on the square suggest its originating standard was perhaps an archaic Greek foot, or 3 ft. multiple—a yard—first mentioned by Hesiod. The three standards represented on the shipwrecked tools indicate that Greek architects of the fifth century B.C.E. used multiple linear measures, traceable to diverse sources.','25',''),('Shipwreck528','La Macchi Tonda','La Macchi Tonda',41.9833333333,11.95,50,100,'',8020,'',613,'','','','','','','Roman Imperial','','','','','','','','','','','','','',''),('Shipwreck1828','La Maddalena','La Maddalena',41.25,9.4166666667,200,300,'C3rd AD',189,'422',614,'Tyrrhenian Sea','Italy','Most northerly point of Sardinia','','','Not reported','Roman Imperial','Bollettino di Archeologia 13-15 (1992), 213-4.','','','1','','','1','Fragments of slabs of marble in different sizes.','Some African tableware.','','','','',''),('Shipwreck1204','La Madonnina','La Madonnina',40.2833333333,17.5333333333,-325,-300,'C4th BC',8022,'',615,'','Italy','Puglia','','','','Hellenistic','http://www.archeomar.it/templates/archeomar/atlante/player_atlante_en.html         site 196, area 10','','1','0','','','0','','Courseware pottery.','','Various objects.','Two stone anchors','',''),('Shipwreck1715','La Madrague de Giens','La Madrague de Giens',43.0333333333,6.1,-70,-50,'',8023,'',616,'Western Mediterranean','France','Var','','','','','','','0','','','','','','','A bronze as, dated to c 187-155 BC,  was found in the mast-step.','','','',''),('Shipwreck664','La Madrague-de-Montredon','La Madrague-de-Montredon',43.2166666667,5.3166666667,-175,-125,'',8024,'',617,'','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','',''),('Shipwreck764','Maestro-Maria','Maestro-Maria',41.6,9.3333333333,0,0,'',8025,'',618,'','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','',''),('Shipwreck2206','Les Magnons','Les Magnons A',43.0666666667,5.75,-50,50,'',8026,'',619,'','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','',''),('Shipwreck602','Les Magnons','Les Magnons B',43.0666666667,5.75,-400,-100,'',8027,'',620,'','','','','','','Classical/Hellenistic','','','','','','','','','','','','','',''),('Shipwreck2516','Mahdia','Mahdia',35.5,11.0666666667,-90,-60,'first half of C1st BC',132,'385',621,'Central Mediterranean','Tunisia','Eastern Tunisia','','','40m deep and 15km from the coast','Roman Republic','A.

Six seasons of exploration, ending in 2009, revealed a narrow trail of pottery about 100 feet long at the northern end of the wreck, according to the US journal Archaeology. This broadened out over an area 65 by 50 feet, and Dr Hadjidaki estimates that the ship itself was between 32 and 50 feet long. It had capsized as it sank, spreading the cargo across the sea-bed. She believes the ship probably looked something like the one shown on a sealstone found on Pseira in 1991, with a beaked prow, high stern, and single mast anchored by ropes. It was probably a coasting vessel, delivering everyday goods to ports along the Cretan shore; whether it used a sails, oars or both is not known. More than 200 pottery vessels have been recovered, about 80 of which are complete enough to be identifiable as amphorae and large jars, used for shipping liquids such as wine and olive oil. Philip Betancourt has dated all the vessels to roughly 1800-1675BC, and the clay from which they were made suggests that the ship took on cargo at two or more locations in eastern Crete.','1','','','','','','Ceramics including jugs, cups and cooking pots.','','','','',''),('Shipwreck2641','Point Iria','Point Iria',37.45727,23.00468,-1250,-1200,'C 13th BC',8657,'',0,'','Greece','Argolid','12','27','27m','Bronze Age','http://www2.rgzm.de/navis/cargo/Iria/Iria.htm            Master Seafarers: The Phoenicians and the Greeks (Periplus, 2004), 105-111.','Cypriotic origin, dated to ca 1200 BC, lying on 12-27 m depth.
