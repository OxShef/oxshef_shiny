<h2>Interactive web apps built with R using Shiny</h2>
</div>
</div>


Shiny is an `R` library that allows R users to create interactive web applications without having to learn HTML, CSS or JavaScript. 

This page includes the "State of Open Data 2017" Shiny app that was developed by the [IDN as a case study for Figshare](https://idn.it.ox.ac.uk/article/state-of-open-data-survey-2017), it was built exclusively from R code - and can be [found on Github](https://github.com/martinjhnhadley/open-data-survey-shiny-app-2017).

This site aims to provide answers to the following questions:

- How do I build Shiny apps?
- How can I share Shiny apps with others?
- Are there any template Shiny apps I can use?
